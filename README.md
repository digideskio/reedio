# Reedio.fm

This is the readme for reedio.fm, a music discovery platform powered by YouTube and EchoNest.

This branch was created with the following goals:

* Revive Reedio with Spotify APIs after echonest APIs shut down
* Refactor from flux implementation to Redux
* Remove gulp and use npm scripts
* Use webpack and Babel for ES6 goodness
* Dockerize it (not really working... node-sass is difficult with it's compilation and node version discrepancies)

I got it up to (sort of) working shape. See my youtube video about it for more details.
